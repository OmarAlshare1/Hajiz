# Security Documentation for Hajiz Application

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Hajiz appointment booking platform and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Token Security**: Enhanced JWT implementation with:
  - Minimum 32-character secret requirement
  - Algorithm specification (HS256)
  - Issuer and audience validation
  - Token expiration (7 days default)
  - Secure token verification

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Provider and customer role separation
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements enforced

### 2. Network Security
- **Host Binding**: Server binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) only
- **CORS Protection**: Strict origin validation
- **Rate Limiting**: 
  - General API: 100 requests per 15 minutes
  - Authentication endpoints: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **MongoDB Injection Prevention**: Using express-mongo-sanitize
- **XSS Protection**: XSS-clean middleware
- **Parameter Pollution Prevention**: HPP middleware
- **Request Size Limiting**: 10MB maximum payload
- **Content-Type Validation**: Strict content type checking

### 4. Security Headers
- **Helmet.js**: Comprehensive security headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP rules
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security
- **X-Frame-Options**: Clickjacking protection
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: MIME type sniffing prevention

### 5. Data Protection
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds
- **Sensitive Data Exclusion**: Passwords excluded from API responses
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Port Binding Vulnerability
**Issue**: Server was binding to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
**Fix**: Changed to bind to localhost only (127.0.0.1)
**Impact**: Prevents external access to development server

### 2. Weak JWT Configuration
**Issue**: Default JWT secret and weak validation
**Fix**: 
- Enforced minimum 32-character secret
- Added algorithm specification
- Enhanced token validation
- Added issuer/audience checks

### 3. Excessive Rate Limiting
**Issue**: Auth endpoints had too permissive rate limits (20 attempts)
**Fix**: Reduced to 5 attempts per 15 minutes for auth endpoints

### 4. Information Disclosure
**Issue**: Console logs in production could expose sensitive data
**Fix**: Conditional logging based on environment

### 5. Insecure Default Values
**Issue**: Default JWT secret and weak configuration examples
**Fix**: Updated .env.example with secure defaults and warnings

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Configuration
1. **Never commit .env files** to version control
2. **Use strong JWT secrets** (minimum 32 characters)
3. **Set NODE_ENV=production** in production
4. **Use MongoDB Atlas** for production database
5. **Enable SSL/TLS** for all external communications

### Development Security
1. **Regular dependency updates**: Run `npm audit` regularly
2. **Code reviews**: Review all security-related changes
3. **Environment separation**: Keep development and production separate
4. **Secure API keys**: Never hardcode API keys in source code

### Production Deployment
1. **Use HTTPS only**: Enforce SSL/TLS
2. **Firewall configuration**: Restrict network access
3. **Regular backups**: Implement secure backup strategy
4. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting
5. **Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated

## Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is set and secure (32+ characters)
- [ ] All environment variables are configured
- [ ] NODE_ENV is set to 'production'
- [ ] Database connection is secure (MongoDB Atlas)
- [ ] API keys are properly configured
- [ ] CORS origins are properly configured
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates are valid

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Run `npm audit` monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies quarterly
- [ ] Review access logs monthly
- [ ] Rotate API keys annually
- [ ] Review and update security policies

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Document the incident
   - Assess the scope of impact

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze logs and system state
   - Identify root cause
   - Determine data exposure

3. **Remediation**:
   - Apply security patches
   - Update compromised credentials
   - Implement additional controls

4. **Recovery**:
   - Restore services securely
   - Monitor for continued threats
   - Update security documentation

## Contact Information

For security-related issues or questions:
- Create a GitHub issue with the 'security' label
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they are fixed

## Security Updates

This document should be reviewed and updated:
- After any security-related changes
- Quarterly as part of security review
- Following any security incidents
- When new threats or vulnerabilities are identified
